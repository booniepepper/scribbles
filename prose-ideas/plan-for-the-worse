"Oh sure, it was a surprise. I wasn't planning on it."

"Not planning on it? It was a [trip to the E.R.!] No one plans for an emergency."

"Oh actually I do usually plan for emergencies. I try to live as though the unexpected is just about to happen, and plan for the worst-case."

"Uh, no thanks. That sounds like a terrible way to live. The anxiety would kill me."

"I said I plan for emergencies, I don't _worry_ about them. Planning gives you confidence, and usually there is not an emergency, which is quite a relief. I find it makes me quite thankful, actually."

"Weird."
